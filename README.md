### zkSync HandBbook for Developers

Fund Your Wallet:
1. Obtain testnet ETH for zkSync using Chainstack's faucet.
2. Alternatively, get SepoliaETH from available faucets and bridge it to zkSync Sepolia testnet.
3. Check your balance using the zkSync Sepolia explorer.

Create the Project:
1. Run npx zksync-cli create hello-zksync to create a new project.
2. Choose the following options:
   - Project type: Contracts
   - Ethereum framework: Ethers v6
   - Template: Hardhat + Solidity
   - (Optional) Private key for deploying contracts
   - Package manager: yarn
3. The project structure includes:
   - hardhat.config.ts for general configuration.
   - /contracts for smart contracts, including examples like ERC20, NFT, and Greeter.
   - /deploy for deployment scripts.
4. Focus on the Greeter.sol contract in /contracts.

Compile the Contract:
1. Navigate to the project directory: cd hello-zksync.
2. Compile the contracts with yarn compile.
3. The output will show the compiled artifacts in the /artifacts-zk folder.

Deploy and Verify:
1. Use the deployment script in /deploy/deploy.ts:
   
TypeScript

   import { deployContract } from "./utils";

   export default async function () {
     const contractArtifactName = "Greeter";
     const constructorArguments = ["Hi there!"];
     await deployContract(contractArtifactName, constructorArguments);
   }
   
2. Run the deployment script with yarn deploy.
3. The script will deploy the contract and verify it, providing details like the contract address and verification ID.

Interact with the Contract:
1. Update the CONTRACT_ADDRESS in /deploy/interact.ts:
   
TypeScript

   import * as hre from "hardhat";
   import { getWallet } from "./utils";
   import { ethers } from "ethers";

   const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "";

   export default async function () {
     console.log(`Running script to interact with contract ${CONTRACT_ADDRESS}`);
     const contractArtifact = await hre.artifacts.readArtifact("Greeter");
     const contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, contractArtifact.abi, getWallet());
     const response = await contract.greet();
     console.log(`Current message is: ${response}`);
     const transaction = await contract.setGreeting("Hello people!");
     console.log(`Transaction hash: ${transaction.hash}`);
     await transaction.wait();
     console.log(`The message now is: ${await contract.greet()}`);
   }
   
2. Run the interaction script with yarn interact.

Takeaways:
- zkSync is EVM compatible, allowing use of Solidity, Vyper, and popular libraries like OpenZeppelin.
- Smart contracts must be compiled with zksolc or zkvyper.
- Deployment and verification scripts streamline the process.
- Interaction with deployed contracts can be done using ethers and other familiar tools.
